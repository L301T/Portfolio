#  Active Directory Lab - Multi-Site Enterprise Management

> Hands-on implementation of role-based access control and security policies in a multi-site Active Directory environment

##  Project Overview

This lab demonstrates enterprise-level user and security management using Active Directory Domain Services. Built a realistic two-location company infrastructure implementing the **principle of least privilege** through organizational units, security groups, and Group Policy Objects.

**Key Achievement:** Successfully prevented unauthorized software installations (IIS) for HR departments across both locations using targeted Group Policy, demonstrating practical application of security best practices.

### 1. Multi-Site OU Structure
*Two-location infrastructure (London & Venice) with separated departments, users, and workstations*

**Design highlights:**
- Geographic separation (London/Venice)
- Department-based organization (IT/HR)
- Dedicated OUs for Users and Workstations
- Enables granular policy application

---

### 2. Security Group Creation

*Creating a Global Security Group for department-level access control*

**Configuration:**
- **Scope:** Global (single-domain users)
- **Type:** Security (for permissions)
- **Naming:** Descriptive convention (e.g., "Managers")

---

### 3. User Account Setup

*Security-first user configuration with mandatory password change*

**Security settings:**
- User must change password at next logon
- ☐ User cannot change password (disabled)
- ☐ Password never expires (disabled)
- ☐ Account is disabled (enabled by default)

---

### 4. User Account Properties
*Account options including expiration dates and password policies*

**Advanced controls:**
- Account expiration (set to March 11, 2026 for this demo user)
- Logon hours restrictions
- Logon location controls
- Password policy enforcement

---

### 5. Group Policy - IIS Installation Prevention
*Policy configured to block IIS installation on HR department computers*

**Policy details:**
- **Setting:** Prevent IIS installation - **Enabled**
- **Scope:** Computer Configuration
- **Target:** Windows Server 2003+ (applies to modern servers)
- **Purpose:** Prevent non-IT staff from installing unnecessary server roles

---

### 6. Group Policy Deployment
*"NO IIS" policy linked to HR departments in both London and Venice locations*

**Implementation:**
- Policy applied to: `London/HR` and `Venice/HR` OUs
- Configuration: Computer Configuration (applies regardless of user)
- Status: Enabled and enforced
- Result: HR workstations cannot install IIS

### Security Groups Strategy

| Group Type | Scope | Use Case |
|------------|-------|----------|
| **Security** | Global | Department-level access (single domain) |
| **Security** | Universal | Cross-location aggregation |
| **Distribution** | N/A | Email only (not for permissions) |

**Example groups created:**
- IT_London (Global Security)
- HR_London (Global Security)
- IT_Venice (Global Security)
- HR_Venice (Global Security)

---

### Group Policy Objects

#### GPO: "NO IIS" - Prevent IIS Installation

**Purpose:** Block HR departments from installing Internet Information Services

**Configuration Path:**
```
Computer Configuration
└── Policies
    └── Administrative Templates
        └── Windows Components
            └── Internet Information Services
                └── Prevent IIS installation: Enabled
```

**Deployment:**
- **Linked to:** London/HR and Venice/HR OUs
- **Enforcement:** Computer-level (applies to all users on HR machines)
- **Scope:** Windows Server 2003 and later

**Why this matters:**
- HR staff don't need web server capabilities
- Reduces attack surface
- Prevents accidental misconfiguration
- Demonstrates least privilege principle

---

##  Security Principles Applied

### Least Privilege
Every user receives only the minimum permissions needed for their role. No excessive administrative rights.

###  Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
Permissions assigned through security groups, never directly to individual users. Enables scalable management.

###  Defense in Depth
Multiple security layers:
1. **Account level:** Password policies, expiration dates
2. **Group level:** Membership-based permissions
3. **OU level:** Organizational separation
4. **Policy level:** GPO restrictions (like IIS block)

### Separation of Duties
Department-specific restrictions ensure IT and HR have different capabilities aligned with their responsibilities.

## What I Learned

### Technical Insights
- **OU design impacts everything:** Structure determines GPO inheritance and delegation possibilities
- **Group scope matters:** Global for single-domain, Universal for cross-domain scenarios
- **Computer vs User configuration:** Computer policies apply regardless of who logs in
- **Security vs Distribution groups:** Only Security groups can assign permissions

### Practical Skills
- Creating realistic organizational structures in AD
- Applying security policies that balance protection with usability
- Troubleshooting GPO application and inheritance
- Documenting infrastructure decisions

### Professional Development
- How to translate business requirements into technical controls
- Importance of least privilege in real-world scenarios
- Value of clear naming conventions and organizational standards


**Advanced goals:**
- [ ] Integrate with Azure AD Connect
- [ ] Set up AD Certificate Services (PKI)
- [ ] Configure Active Directory Federation Services (AD FS)
- [ ] Implement tiered administrative model
