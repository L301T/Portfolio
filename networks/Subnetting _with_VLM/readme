Project Overview

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a network using Variable Length Subnet Masking (VLSM) and static routing in Cisco Packet Tracer.
The objective was to optimize IP address allocation starting from a single Class C network and to interconnect multiple LAN segments efficiently, minimizing address waste and ensuring proper routing between subnets.

Goals

Design an IP addressing plan using VLSM based on the number of required hosts in each subnet.

Configure routers and switches to interconnect four LANs and one point-to-point link.

Implement static routes for inter-network communication.

Test connectivity between all hosts using ping and verify routing paths.

Project Description – VLSM Subnetting and Static Routing

In this scenario, I applied subnetting using VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking).
Starting from a single IP network, the goal was to optimize and distribute IP addresses efficiently among different local networks according to their host requirements.

Each subnet must reserve one address for the network ID and one for the broadcast, so the formula used to calculate the number of available hosts is:

Hosts
=
2
𝑛
−
2
Hosts=2
n
−2

Based on the required number of hosts, we determine how many bits to borrow for the network portion, ensuring an efficient use of the available address space.
By convention, the first usable address in each subnet is assigned to the network devices (e.g., PCs), while the last usable address is reserved for the router’s gateway interface.

🔹 Step 1 — Subnet for 64 Hosts

The network with the highest number of hosts (64) is created first.
We borrow one additional bit for the network portion, resulting in a /25 subnet mask (255.255.255.128).

Network: 192.168.5.0/25

Host range: 192.168.5.1 – 192.168.5.126

Broadcast: 192.168.5.127

Default gateway: 192.168.5.126

Example host: 192.168.5.1

🔹 Step 2 — Subnet for 45 Hosts

Next, we create a subnet for 45 hosts.
Starting from the next available address (192.168.5.128), we apply a /26 mask (255.255.255.192), which provides 62 usable host addresses.

Network: 192.168.5.128/26

Host range: 192.168.5.129 – 192.168.5.190

Broadcast: 192.168.5.191

Default gateway: 192.168.5.190

Example host: 192.168.5.129

🔹 Step 3 — Subnet for 14 Hosts

The third network requires 14 hosts.
Since growth is not expected, we can use a /28 subnet mask (255.255.255.240), which provides exactly 14 usable addresses.

Network: 192.168.5.192/28

Host range: 192.168.5.193 – 192.168.5.206

Broadcast: 192.168.5.207

Default gateway: 192.168.5.206

Example host: 192.168.5.193

🔹 Step 4 — Subnet for Another 14 Hosts

We apply the same /28 mask (255.255.255.240) to the next subnet.

Network: 192.168.5.208/28

Host range: 192.168.5.209 – 192.168.5.222

Broadcast: 192.168.5.223

Default gateway: 192.168.5.222

Example host: 192.168.5.209

🔹 Step 5 — Point-to-Point Connection

For the router-to-router connection, only two IP addresses are required.
A /30 mask (255.255.255.252) is ideal since it provides two usable host addresses.

Network: 192.168.5.224/30

IP 1 (Router 1 interface): 192.168.5.225

IP 2 (Router 2 interface): 192.168.5.226

Broadcast: 192.168.5.227

⚙️ Static Routing Configuration

Finally, static routing is configured so that packets can be forwarded between all subnets.

Example (on Router 1):

ip route 192.168.5.192 255.255.255.240 192.168.5.226


This route allows Router 1 to reach the 192.168.5.192/28 network via the point-to-point interface connected to Router 2.
